# Sannamaija-Bot
Discord bot made for the Tilu 24G server. The bot is not public, only on one server.
The bot works fine with Visual Studio Code and Python extension from Microsoft. 

I don't know if it work somewhere else than Visual Studio Code but code extensions are there so big recommendation to run it on Visual Studio Code.

This is my very first Discord bot so everything might not work all the time. Hopefully I'm wrong.

The main language in the bot are Finnish and you can always change it to English if you want.

The code contain lot of commands over 21 commands.

# Instructions for deploying the bot
1. Download Visual Studio Code
2. Download all the files in the repository
3. Download these pip extensions: discord.py, yt-dlp, dotenv and pytz 
4. Change the .env file to your own Bot Token and Application ID
5. Run the file and have fun!
- Also change these sections of the main code: YOUR_CHANNEL, YOUR_ROLE, YOUR_FILE_LOCATION and YOUR_FORBIDDEN_WORDS
- Also you need a make bot in the Discord Developer Portal.
